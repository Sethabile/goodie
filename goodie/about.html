                <p>Hi, there. We are sisters who were obssessed with bags from a younng age. We shared our struggles<br> 
                    of buying good quality bags at affordable prices. Which is why we started Goodie in 2018.<br> 
                    Goodie is a purely South African company which produces quality and luxurious. Our bags are<br> 
                    produced with local materials by locals</p>
